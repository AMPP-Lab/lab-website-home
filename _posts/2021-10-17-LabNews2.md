Announcing the [official site](http://cancervariants.org/) of the Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC) as a [Global Alliance for Genomics Health (GA4GH)](https://www.ga4gh.org/) Driver Project. This Project is co-led by Drs. Malachi and Obi Griffith of Washington University and Drs. Nuria Lopez-Bigas and David Tamborero of the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology with the goal of bringing together the leading institutions that are independently developing comprehensive cancer variant interpretation databases. This includes the Griffith Lab's [Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer (CIViC)](civicdb.org) knowledgebase. Read more about the VICC or join the effort at [cancervariants.org](http://cancervariants.org/).
