{% include team_member member_name="Mike" full_name="Mike Chmielewski" bio='Dr. Chmielewski’s research, which spans multiple disciplines of psychology, focuses on improving our ability to measure and understand psychological constructs. For example, one line of research examines the structure of psychopathology and ways to improve how psychopathology is classified.  Another line focuses on the development of “normal” personality traits and their associations with other constructs (e.g., psychopathology, health behaviors).  Much of his work focuses on psychometrics and the development and evaluation of psychological tests, measures, and assessments.' image="/lab-website-home/assets/img/team/mike_chmielewski.png" role="Principal Investigator" %}

Her ongoing interests concern the enablement of precision medicine through the identification of clinically relevant variants that aid in better prognosis and diagnosis of cancer syndromes and the development of web resources to aid in the interpretation and discovery of such clinically relevant variants. Currently Kaitlin curates information relating to von-Hippel Lindau disease (VHLD), a neoplastic syndrome resulting from the inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Her project aides to the overall goal of the CIViC project by developing a comprehensive web source of VHL variants. In the future Kaitlin hopes to pursue an MD/PhD in integrative genomics.' image="/assets/img/team/kaitlin_clark.png" role="Undergraduate Student, uSTAR Fellow" %}
