{% include team_member member_name="Mike" full_name="Mike Chmielewski" bio='Dr. Chmielewski’s research, which spans multiple disciplines of psychology, focuses on improving our ability to measure and understand psychological constructs. For example, one line of research examines the structure of psychopathology and ways to improve how psychopathology is classified.  Another line focuses on the development of “normal” personality traits and their associations with other constructs (e.g., psychopathology, health behaviors).  Much of his work focuses on psychometrics and the development and evaluation of psychological tests, measures, and assessments.' image="/lab-website-home/assets/img/team/mike_chmielewski.png" role="Principal Investigator" %}
