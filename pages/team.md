{% include team_member member_name="Mike" full_name="Mike Chmielewski" bio='Across all areas of science, it is essential that models of the phenomenon of interest are as accurate as possible. Moreover, measurement is critical to all areas of research. The overarching goal of Dr. Mike Chmielewski&#39;s research is to enhance the accuracy of our models of psychopathology/clinically relevant constructs and improve our ability to measure/assess these constructs. Dr. Chmielewski (he/him) accomplishes this through three inter-related programs of research: (1) by focusing on psychometrics, construct validity, measurement, and scale development, (2) by enhancing the conceptualization and classification of psychopathology through empirically based structural models, and (3) by examining links of normal personality traits with psychopathology and other psychological constructs.  Dr. Chmielewski also has multiple ongoing collaborations allowing him to apply these lines of research to health and developmental psychology.  Recently, Dr. Chmielewski has become interested in identifying other barriers to replicable and valid research. <br> <br> Email: <a href="mailto:mchmielewski@mail.smu.edu"> mchmielewski@mail.smu.edu </a>' image="/lab-website-home/assets/img/team/Mike.jpg" title="CV" link="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WlKAhklst5CR1C948LL5Jn88oOZRJDll/view?usp=sharing" %}

In May 2020 she graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University at Buffalo, earning her B.A. in Psychology with Highest Honors and completing minors in Sociology and Counseling. Her personal research program centers on combining psychometric research and measurement development procedures with Ecological Momentary Assessment methodologies to clarify and model the structure of psychopathology. Alexa aims to understand the differences in within- and between-person structures of personality and internalizing psychopathology, and to use this information to inform dimensional models of psychopathology. <br> <br> Email: <a href="mailto:alexajimenez@mail.smu.edu"> alexajimenez@mail.smu.edu </a>' image="/lab-website-home/assets/img/team/Alexa.JPG" title="CV" link="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16L9UG-6QEV6i5FRtsvkA4HtD-_csXrpG/view?usp=sharing"%}

{% include team_member member_name="Elizabeth" full_name="Elizabeth Bell" bio='Elizabeth Bell (she/they) is a third-year doctoral student in the Clinical Psychology program. They earned a BS with research distinction in Psychology and minors in Women and Gender Studies, Neuroscience, Cognitive Science, and Statistics from SMU in May 2022. Their research interests are rooted in a) measurement, b) the dimensional structure of psychopathology, and c) intersectionality. Their current work is on the role of repetitive thinking—a broad construct that taps aspects of ruminations, obsessions, worries, and several other maladaptive cognitive processes—as an underlying mechanism of psychopathology and personality. As they continue studying individual differences in mental health outcomes, they plan to examine factors related to gender, sexual, racial, ethnic identity and community contexts, such as stigmatization and cultural pride. In line with the purposes of open science, their goal is to promote greater inclusivity and representation of diverse experiences in clinical science. <br> <br> Email: <a href="mailto:belle@mail.smu.edu"> belle@mail.smu.edu </a>' image="/lab-website-home/assets/img/team/Elizabeth.jpg" title="CV" link="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TNNcoxidV8YScoxEBraHUsuvBw8FMN5M/view?usp=sharing"%}
